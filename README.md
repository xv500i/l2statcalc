# L2 Stat Calc

## Description

This project is about creating a simulator. This simulator works should be able to do calculations about the characters' statistics, combat effectiveness and so on.

The main problem is that there is a lot of data to work with.

## Functionality

The simulator has to provide:
* Complete statistics calculation (i.e.: Physical attack, Magic attack, elemental resistances)
* The use of shots
* Combat calculations with stereotyped (i.e.: reference) characters/monsters

The simulator has to work with:
* Equipment effects including Enchant, SA and Augments
* Altered states (i.e.: Buffs, Passives, Debuffs and Toggles) effects
* Level effects
* Dyes effects
* Characters action (i.e.: walking, running, standing and sitting) effects

## Scope

The scope of this project is to develop a simulator. The simulator has to be executable in an easy way. For the moment we've thought creating a webpage with javascript core for the simulator

Due to simulator data is static, we won't use any database at first.
