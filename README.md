# L2 Stat Calc

## Description

This project is about creating a game simulator. This simulator should be able to do calculations about the characters' statistics, combat effectiveness and so on.

The main problem is that there is a lot of data to work with.

## Functionality

The simulator has to provide:
* Complete statistics calculation (i.e.: Physical attack, Magic attack, elemental resistances)
* The use of all kinds of shots
* Combat calculations with stereotyped (i.e.: reference) characters/monsters
* Buffs, Debuffs, pasives, etc.

The simulator has to work with:
* Equipment effects including Enchant, SA, Sets and Augments
* Altered states (i.e.: Buffs, Passives, Debuffs and Toggles) effects
* Level effects
* Dyes effects
* Characters action (i.e.: walking, running, standing and sitting) effects

## Scope

The scope of this project is to develop a simulator. The simulator has to be executable in an easy way. For the moment we've thought creating a webpage with javascript core for the simulator

Due to simulator data is static, we won't use any database at first.

## Management

### Tasks

The project will be break down in several tasks. The manager will assign and validate each task. A complete list with the actual tasks will be published here.

### Procedures

Although using a repository, some considerations have to be taken when working with a few people team. Some workflows have been created in order to establish basic rules. The procedures can be found under the Documentation directory.

### Testing

We will perform unit testing for each class or module with QUnit.
